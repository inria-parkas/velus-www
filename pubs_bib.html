    Synchronous languages are used to program critical control applications.
    The Scade language, used in industry for these applications, is based on
    the Lustre language introduced by Caspi and Halbwachs. In this article
    we treat the formalization and proof, in the Coq proof assistant, of a
    key compilation pass: the translation of programs from Lustre into an
    imperative language. The challenge is to change from a synchronous
    dataflow semantics, where programs manipulate streams, to an imperative
    semantics, where the program manipulates memory sequentially. We specify
    and verify a simple code generator that treats core Lustre features:
    sampling, nodes, and delays. The proof uses an intermediate semantic
    model that mixes dataflow and imperative characteristics and allows the
    statement of an essential inductive invariant. We exploit this
    formalization to verify a classic optimization that fuses conditional
    structures in the generated imperative code.

    The correct compilation of block diagram languages like Lustre, Scade,
    and a discrete subset of Simulink is important since they are used to
    program critical embedded control software. We describe the
    specification and verification in an Interactive Theorem Prover of a
    compilation chain that treats the key aspects of Lustre: sampling,
    nodes, and delays. Building on CompCert, we show that repeated execution
    of the generated assembly code faithfully implements the dataflow
    semantics of source programs.

    We resolve two key technical challenges. The first is the change from a
    synchronous dataflow semantics, where programs manipulate streams of
    values, to an imperative one, where computations manipulate memory
    sequentially. The second is the verified compilation of an imperative
    language with encapsulated state to C code where the state is realized
    by nested records. We also treat a standard control optimization that
    eliminates unnecessary conditional statements.

  abstract = {
    Lustre is a synchronous language for programming systems as block
    diagrams from which low-level imperative code is generated
    automatically. Recent work applies the Coq interactive proof assistant
    to specify a compiler from a core subset of Lustre to the Clight input
    language of CompCert from which assembly code is generated. The overall
    correctness proof connects the stream semantics of Lustre to the
    imperative semantics of the assembly code.

    Every stream in a Lustre program is associated with a static ‘clock’
    that represents when it is active. Compilation transforms the clocks
    into conditional statements that control when the corresponding value
    are calculated. Previous work made the simplifying assumption that the
    inputs and outputs of any given block shared the same static clock. This
    paper describes one way to lift this restriction. It requires enriching
    the static typing rules for clocks and the semantic model, and, to
    satisfy the Clight semantics, adding a compilation pass to ensure that
    any variable passed to a function call has been initialized.

    This paper presents ongoing work to add a modular reset construct to a
    verified Lustre compiler. We present a novel formal specification for
    the construct and sketch our plans to integrate it into the compiler and
